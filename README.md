# Aashish Paruvada's Minimal Portfolio

This site is not broken! It is intentionally designed to reflect my interest in vintage and early internet webpages. The minimal, retro look is a stylistic choice inspired by the simplicity and charm of the 2000s web. If you appreciate old-school web aesthetics, you'll feel right at home here.
